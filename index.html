    <p><b> HTML and Web Basics </b></p>

<p>The <em> World Wide Web</em> is a collection of HTML documents. <em> HTML</em> stands for hypertext markup language; it is the code behind HTML documents that tells computers and browsers how to display information. <em> HTTP</em> stands for hypertext
  transfer protocol; it defines the rules for transferring files among computers and software (like browsers) on the world wide web.</p>

HTML is composed of the following:
<ul>
  <li>text</li>
  <li>markup</li>
  <li>references to other documents (like vidoes, images, audio files, etc)</li>
  <li>links to other documents (i.e. pages)</li>
</ul>

An <em> element </em> of HTML is composed of:
<ul>
  <li>an opening tag</li>
  <li>content</li>
  <li>a closing tag (except in the case of void tags)</li>
</ul>

<p>Tags may have multiple <em>attributes</em> which add  or change the functionality of an element.</p>

<p> In general, don't worry about memorizing bits of code; anything you haven't memorized by common use is easily found with a Google search.</p>
